Workshop 2 - Reflect

1)	What happens to dynamic memory if it is not deallocated?
2)	Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory when you increase the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory?
3)	The Kingdom structure stores the name in an array of characters. At the end of the program, we do not use the delete operator to deallocate the memory occupied by the name. Do we have a memory leak there? Ex-plain.
4)	In your program, there are two display(...) functions. How does the compiler know which one should be called from your main? Explain.
5)	Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
