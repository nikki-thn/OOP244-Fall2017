5.Putting source code in modules is benefitial for large and complex program. Dividing code into modulas are easy to handle or upgrade and to maintain should the need arise. 

6.I have learned how to seperate source code into modulas and what goes into header files, what goes into the implementation files. How to compile each module and create or add new files in Visual studio.
