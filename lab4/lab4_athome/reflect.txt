1)	What is meant by a safe empty state? What other safe empty states could you choose for the Passenger type? Explain why.
    Safe empty state is a well-defined state of an object from the time of its creation untill all of the object's instance variables are set (similar to initialization). This prevents object to break or behave unexpected even if they are being accessed before setting.

2)	Describe how you would modify the code to minimize duplication using the syntax that you have covered in the course to date.
    By seperate codes into reusable porttion. For example, I use constructor with no parameter to set safety state for code, then next time to set safety state, I just call the constructor instead of re-write the block of codes.
    
3)	Explain the principal benefit of minimizing code duplication.
    Less code, less typing, less bugs, minimize typo, easy to maintain or to fix or to upgrade.
    
4)	Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the pri-vate data variables of the referenced object.
    Because of pass-by-reference

5)	Describe how you would improve your code to allow for changes in the siz-es of the arrays holding the name and destination data.
    Need a code to allow user to input the size, then we need to delete existing allocated memory, allocated new memory and re-assign

6)	What do you need to correct when you use the strncpy(...) function?
    strncpy copy string up to a certain amount of character without needing the '\0' character. We need to know how many bytes to copy.
    
7)	Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
