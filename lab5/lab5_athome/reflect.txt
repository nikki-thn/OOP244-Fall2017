1.	Discuss why the operator+ should return a Fraction object and not a reference to a Fraction object
    Because the operator+ return a complete new object 

2.	Identify the temporary objects in the tester module
    (a+b), (b+d) and (b+=d)

3.	Identify the simplifications that you made to your class without affecting the in-terface to the client code
    The operators implementation are to simplify the client code, for example, the operator+ allows us to add two objects using a simple + sign in the interface.
    
4.  Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
    I this workshop, I learned a deeper understanding the usage of & in object qualifier and when to use const. I learned how to construct overload operator to simplify client code and reduce code repeatation for client. I learned how to implement overload operators and when to use const for query (vs modifier)
