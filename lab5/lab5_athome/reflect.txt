1.	Discuss why the operator+= should return a reference to Fraction.
    We return a reference because we want to keep changes to the current object
    
    
2.	List your uses of the pointer to the current object to simplify your code.
    I have used the current object *this whenever asked to set safety state, I also used it when I need to assign a copy of current object to a temporary address, I used it to return a refence to Fraction
    

3.	Identify the temporary objects in the tester module.
    object a, c

4.	Identify simplifications that you could make to your class without affecting the interface to the client code.
    

5.	Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
