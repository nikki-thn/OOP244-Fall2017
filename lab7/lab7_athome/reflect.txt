1.	Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class?

    No, the Hero class doesn't need to know because it is a complete class by itself.

2.	Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? 

    Yes, it needs to because SuperHero is derived from Hero class aka it needs the Hero class to be completed. 

3.	The program prints out “Ancient Battle!” when 2 Heroes fight. It prints out “Super Fight!” when 2 SuperHeroes fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?

    It prints out "Ancient Battle!", it appears that the based class of operator* got called.

4.	True or False: are the following a valid program definition for main? 
int main()
{
  Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5);
}

how about this?

int main()
{
 (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5)) 
                          *
 (Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2));
}

    True, I put it on the compiler and they run with no error.



* Reflect on midterm:

I learnt that when an object is pass-by-value the copy constructor and destructor got call. I also learnt the syntax for conversion operator.
