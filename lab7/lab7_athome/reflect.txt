1.	Why did we choose m_health to be a signed integer? (Hint: what happens if the Hero has a health of 1, and someone does 2 points of damage to them.)
2.	Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the class SuperHero? (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere in it?) How about the reverse, does SuperHero know about the Hero class?
3.	The program prints out “AncientBattle!” when 2 Heros fight. It prints out “SuperFight!” when 2 SuperHeros fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?
4.	True or False: are the following a valid program definition for main? 
int main()
{
  Hero ("Achilles",  20, 6) * Hero  ("Hector",    30, 5);
}

how about this?

int main()
{
  ( Hero ("Achilles",  20, 6) * Hero ("Hector",    30, 5) ) 
                              *
  ( Hero ("Atalanta",  10, 3) * Hero ("Hippolyta", 10, 2) );
}
