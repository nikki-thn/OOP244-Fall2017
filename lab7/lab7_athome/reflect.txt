1.	Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class? (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere?) 
2.	Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? (Hint: do a search in SuperHero.cpp, does the word “Hero” appear anywhere?)
3.	The program prints out “Ancient Battle!” when 2 Heroes fight. It prints out “Super Fight!” when 2 SuperHeroes fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?
4.	True or False: are the following a valid program definition for main? 
int main()
{
  Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5);
}

how about this?

int main()
{
 (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5)) 
                          *
 (Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2));
}
